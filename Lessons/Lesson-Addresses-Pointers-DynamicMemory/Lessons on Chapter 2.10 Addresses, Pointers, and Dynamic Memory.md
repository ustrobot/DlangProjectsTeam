Chapter **2.10 ‚ÄúAddresses, Pointers, and Dynamic Memory‚Äù** is foundational for understanding how memory and references work under the hood of object-oriented programming.

Here‚Äôs a **lesson plan (4 lessons / 2 pairs)** built around this chapter, designed for a programming course transitioning from procedural to OOP thinking. It emphasizes understanding, safe practice, and application to dynamic structures.

# üß≠ Lesson Plan: ‚ÄúAddresses, Pointers, and Dynamic Memory‚Äù

### üìò Source

Based on *A. V. Stolyarov ‚Äî ‚Äú–ê–∑—ã –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è‚Äù, Chapter 2.10*
Goal: teach students to understand and safely manipulate memory through pointers, and to use dynamic memory for flexible data structures.

## üß© Lesson 1 (Pair 1): Addresses and Pointer Fundamentals

### **Learning Goals**

* Understand what a memory address is.
* Learn what a pointer is and how to declare and use it.
* Learn dereferencing and pointer types.

### **Theory (40 min)**

1. Concept of memory and addresses (RAM layout, variable locations).
2. Pointer declaration and initialization (`int *p; p = &x;`).
3. Dereferencing operator `*` ‚Äî accessing and modifying values through pointers.
4. Pointer types and the importance of matching data types.
5. Null pointer and uninitialized pointers.

### **Practice (40 min)**

* Simple exercises:

  * Print variable addresses with `&`.
  * Assign and dereference pointers.
  * Modify a variable through a pointer.
  * Observe pointer size for different types.

### **Homework / Lab**

* Write a function that swaps two variables using pointers.
* Experiment: print addresses of local variables and explain differences.

## üß© Lesson 2 (Pair 2): Pointer Arithmetic and Arrays

### **Learning Goals**

* Understand pointer arithmetic.
* Learn to navigate arrays with pointers.
* Recognize memory layout and boundaries.

### **Theory (40 min)**

1. Arithmetic on pointers: `p + 1`, `p - 1`, and difference between pointers.
2. Relationship between arrays and pointers (`int a[5]; int *p = a;`).
3. Accessing array elements via pointer arithmetic.
4. Dangers of going out of bounds and undefined behavior.

### **Practice (40 min)**

* Implement functions to:

  * Iterate through an array using pointers only.
  * Compute sum and average using pointers.
  * Compare array access via `a[i]` and `*(a + i)`.

### **Homework**

* Implement a function that reverses an array using pointers (no indexing).

## üß© Lesson 3 (Pair 3): Dynamic Memory Allocation

### **Learning Goals**

* Learn how to allocate and free memory dynamically.
* Understand `malloc`/`free` in C and `new`/`delete` in C++.
* Recognize and prevent memory leaks.

### **Theory (40 min)**

1. Stack vs Heap: what‚Äôs static vs dynamic memory.
2. Allocation functions/operators:

   * C: `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`.
   * C++: `new`, `delete`, `new[]`, `delete[]`.
3. Checking allocation success.
4. Common errors: leaks, double-free, dangling pointers.

### **Practice (40 min)**

* Write a program that:

  * Dynamically allocates an integer array.
  * Reads data, processes it, and frees memory.
  * Prints memory addresses before and after reallocation.

### **Homework**

* Implement a function to resize a dynamic array manually (create new, copy, delete old).

## üß© Lesson 4 (Pair 4): Dynamic Data Structures

### **Learning Goals**

* Apply dynamic memory to real data structures.
* Understand linked structures and how to manage them safely.

### **Theory (40 min)**

1. Dynamic data structures: linked lists as example.
2. Node structure with `value` and `next` pointer.
3. Creating, linking, traversing, and deleting nodes.
4. Practical memory safety tips (nullptr assignment, freeing order).

### **Practice (40 min)**

* Implement a minimal singly linked list:

  * Add node to head or tail.
  * Traverse and print list.
  * Delete all nodes safely.

### **Homework / Project**

* Create a simple dynamic list or stack using pointers.
* Optional: implement a ‚Äúmemory leak detector‚Äù (track allocations).

## üß† Learning Outcomes

By the end of these 4 lessons, students will:

* Understand how data is stored and referenced in memory.
* Be able to safely use and manipulate pointers.
* Understand the relationship between arrays and pointers.
* Be able to allocate, reallocate, and free dynamic memory.
* Create basic dynamic structures (like linked lists) manually.

Would you like me to extend this into a **full 8-lesson mini-module** (with quizzes, projects, and debugging exercises), or keep it as a compact 4-lesson block within your OOP course plan?
